# Automatic-grass-cutting-Robot
A simulation of an autonomous grass-cutting robot designed for efficient lawn maintenance. It demonstrates systematic cutting and obstacle avoidance using advanced algorithms. Built with robotics frameworks, it focuses on path planning and sensors. Future work aims to transition from simulation to real-world implementation.
